        <div class="help">
        <p>Seeking help is often the first step towards getting and staying well, but it can be hard to know how to start or where to turn to. It's common to feel unsure, and to wonder whether you should try to handle things on your own. But it's always ok to ask for help â€“ even if you're not sure you are experiencing a specific mental health problem.</p>
        <form class="p-3 border bg-white">
            <p>You might want to seek help if you're:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>finding it hard to enjoy your life</li>
                <li>having thoughts and feelings that are difficult to cope with, which have an impact on your day-to-day life</li>
                <li>interested to find more support or treatment.</li>
            </ul>
        </form>
